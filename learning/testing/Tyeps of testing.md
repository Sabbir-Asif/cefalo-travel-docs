# Types of Testing in Software Development

## 1. Unit Tests

### What It Is:

Tests individual functions, methods, or classes in complete isolation from the rest of the system.

### Responsibility:

* Validate correctness of **internal logic**
* Ensure **pure business logic** produces the expected output for given inputs
* Detect logic bugs early

### Characteristics:

* No database, network, or file I/O
* Use mocks/stubs to isolate dependencies
* Fast and deterministic

### When to Use:

* Always use for **service layer**
* Test any reusable or critical logic (e.g., calculations, date matching, validation functions)

### Why:

* Catches bugs early
* Encourages clean, modular code
* Enables safe refactoring

---

## 2. Integration Tests

### What It Is:

Tests multiple units/modules together to verify they work correctly as a group.

### Responsibility:

* Validate that **components interact correctly**
  (e.g., controller → service → repository → database)
* Ensure system boundaries (like DBs or external APIs) behave as expected

### Characteristics:

* Uses real or in-memory databases (e.g., test Postgres)
* May use test API servers
* Slower than unit tests, but more realistic

### When to Use:

* When the service logic depends heavily on DB queries
* To test migrations, seed data, and full repository behavior

### Why:

* Catches integration errors that unit tests miss
* Ensures modules don't just work in isolation, but also together

---

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

### What It Is:

Simulates real-world usage by testing the **entire application** from the perspective of a user or client.

### Responsibility:

* Validate full workflows, such as:

  * "User logs in"
  * "User creates a trip"
  * "User adds a wishlist item"

### Characteristics:

* Uses a real server (Express) and real database
* Tests across HTTP, often using tools like Supertest or Playwright
* Slowest but most comprehensive

### When to Use:

* Before a release
* For critical flows (authentication, checkout, trip sharing)
* For automated CI validation

### Why:

* Provides the highest level of confidence
* Catches bugs caused by misconfigurations, middleware issues, or integration points

---

## 4. Functional Tests

### What It Is:

Tests whether the application functions according to **business requirements**.

### Responsibility:

* Validate the correctness of a specific feature or use case
* Can overlap with E2E or integration tests

### Characteristics:

* Often written from a user or product owner's perspective
* Can be manual or automated
* May focus more on behavior than code structure

### When to Use:

* For feature sign-off
* During UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

### Why:

* Validates that the app does what users or stakeholders expect

---

## 5. Smoke Tests

### What It Is:

A minimal set of tests that verify the core functionality of the system is working.

### Responsibility:

* Ensure the app is **not broken** before further testing or deployment
* Often runs in CI/CD pipelines after deployment

### Characteristics:

* Covers only basic routes or features
* Should be fast and reliable

### When to Use:

* After build/deployment
* As a lightweight pre-check before full test suite

### Why:

* Quickly detects fatal issues before deeper testing is done

---

## 6. Regression Tests

### What It Is:

Tests that make sure **new code doesn't break existing features**.

### Responsibility:

* Retest previously working features after code changes
* Ensure system stability

### Characteristics:

* Can be unit, integration, or E2E tests reused over time
* Often included in the regular test suite

### When to Use:

* Always — your existing test suite acts as regression coverage

### Why:

* Protects against unintended side effects of code changes

---

## 7. Performance/Load Tests

### What It Is:

Tests the system under **heavy load or stress** to evaluate performance characteristics.

### Responsibility:

* Identify bottlenecks
* Measure response times, throughput, and scalability

### Characteristics:

* Simulates many users or large data volume
* Uses tools like Artillery, k6, or JMeter

### When to Use:

* Before major releases
* For APIs that must support high traffic (e.g., real-time group chat)

### Why:

* Prevents crashes under real-world usage
* Ensures system scalability

---

## 8. Acceptance Tests

### What It Is:

High-level tests conducted to determine whether the system meets **business requirements** and is acceptable for delivery.

### Responsibility:

* Validate the system’s compliance with business rules
* Often written in collaboration with product owners

### Characteristics:

* Usually manual or scripted with natural language tools like Cucumber
* Business-centric

### When to Use:

* Before final approval and release

### Why:

* Ensures stakeholder satisfaction
* Acts as formal validation of system requirements

## When to Use Which (Quick Table)

| Test Type   | Use Case                   | Speed  | Cost   | Scope       |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| Unit        | Logic correctness          | Fast   | Low    | Narrow      |
| Integration | Component interaction      | Medium | Medium | Moderate    |
| End-to-End  | Full system workflows      | Slow   | High   | Broad       |
| Functional  | Feature-level expectations | Medium | Medium | Feature     |
| Smoke       | Basic app health           | Fast   | Low    | Shallow     |
| Regression  | Prevent breakage           | Varies | Varies | All levels  |
| Performance | Load testing               | Slow   | High   | Full system |
| Acceptance  | Final user validation      | Slow   | High   | Business    |

## Summary

* **Start with unit tests** to stabilize business logic.
* **Add integration tests** to verify interactions and data flow.
* **Use controller-level Supertest tests** for HTTP validation.
* **Add E2E tests** for core user flows (e.g., login, trip creation).
* **Include smoke tests** in CI/CD to catch fatal issues fast.
* **Expand coverage with regression and performance tests** as the system grows.
